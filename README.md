**Diabetes Prediction Web Application**
_Project Overview_
The Diabetes Prediction Web Application is an interactive tool designed to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain health features. Using machine learning models, this web application takes user inputs such as Glucose, BMI, Insulin, and Age to provide a prediction. It helps individuals assess their risk for diabetes and encourages early detection and lifestyle changes.

This project demonstrates how machine learning and web technologies can work together to create practical, real-world applications that can improve public health awareness.

_Features_
User Input Form: The application allows users to enter their details such as Glucose, BMI, Insulin, and Age.
Prediction: Based on the entered data, the model predicts whether the individual is at risk for diabetes.
User-Friendly Interface: A clean, responsive web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Real-time Results: The model immediately provides predictions after the user submits their data.
Technologies Used
Flask: A Python web framework used for building the backend of the application.
Scikit-Learn: A machine learning library used to train the model for diabetes prediction.
HTML/CSS: Used for creating the structure and styling of the web pages.
JavaScript: Used for enhancing the interactivity of the web page.
Bootstrap: Used for making the web interface responsive and modern.
Joblib: Used to serialize the trained machine learning model for later use.
